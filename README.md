The bot serves files from the host machine.

Type "help" in the console for a list of commands.

Formatting info for token and allowed users + paths is available at console startup.

In-chat help is available by typing "/help" to the bot.

It is possible to give strictly read or read+write permissions to users.

File size limits enforced on bots by the Telegram service still apply. As of the last update to this document, that limit is 50MB.
