# FileBot - Telegram file server bot for Windows 7 and higher, 64-bit written in Python 2.7

This bot is based on the Telepot library by nickcoala. (https://github.com/nickoala/telepot)

The bot serves files from the host machine.

Type "help" in the console for a list of commands.

Formatting info for token and allowed users + paths is available at console startup.

In-chat help is available by typing "/help" to the bot.

It is possible to give strictly read or read+write permissions to users.

The file "7z.exe" from the 7-ZIP application is required in FileBot's folder.

File size limits enforced on bots by the Telegram service still apply. As of the last update to this document, that limit is 50MB.
